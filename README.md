# Mini-Project-Keylogger
This is a keylogger that not only logs keys, but it also logs what window you are on. 

As an example, if you are on facebook, and you login your email and password, this application will write to a file that you were on facebook, and it will write what you had typed, leaving your facebook account available on that text file. I intentionally didn't code it so that it would send an email with all of someone's information. This doesn't just work on your internet browser, but it also logs what you type when you're playing games, or if your window is focused on another application.
